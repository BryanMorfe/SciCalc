# SciCalc
#### Version
Beta - Not Released

## Description
Scientific Calculator written in C++ and Qt that allows users to write full mathematical expressions such as `5 * sqrt(2 - cos [2/9])`. SciCalc allows arbitrary function definition that can be used in the mathematical expressions.

## TODO
* Expression validator is not yet coded.
* Default functions are still unavailable. Must be enabled by correct parsing and evaluation.
* User-defined functions are still unavailable.

## Known Bugs
* Adding a token with the keyboard may result in an incorrect expression being displayed.
